# üçù **Philosophers**

Solving the classic [*Dining Philosophers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) problem in **C**, using **threads** and **mutex locks**.

Picture this:
Five philosophers sit around a circular table with a bowl of spaghetti. 
There's five forks, but each philosopher needs **two forks** to eat.

Who gets the forks first? The hungriest philosopher of course! 
And remember philosophers need to sleep and do some thinking too..!

## Key concepts to tackle

**Thread Management**
  Creating and coordinating multiple threads safely
**Mutex Synchronization**
  Protecting shared resources (forks) from data race conditions  
**Deadlock Prevention**
  Implementing strategies to avoid circular wait conditions
**Resource Scheduling**
  Ensuring fair access to limited resources
**Performance Optimization**: Balancing efficiency with safety in concurrent systems

## Solution

‚ö° **Zero Deadlocks**: Bulletproof synchronization strategy
üîÑ **Fair Resource Distribution**: No philosopher starves
üìä **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status updates for each philosopher
üß† **Memory Safe**: Valgrind-clean implementation
‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable timing and philosopher count

## Installation

Clone the repo and run **make**

## Usage

Please launch **./philo** with the following arguments:
  1. the number of philosophers
  2. the time (in ms) when a philosopher should die
  3. the time (in ms) it takes for a philosopher to eat
  4. the time (in ms) a philosopher will spend sleeping
  (optional)
  5. the number of times each philosopher eats

## Examples

`./philo 3 800 200 200`

`./philo 100 600 300 100 5`
